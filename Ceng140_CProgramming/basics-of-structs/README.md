# Basics of Structs
In this quiz, you will complete two functions that make some simple operations on struct Person type.</br>
For the definition of struct Person, you may check question.h but please do not modify <b>question.h</b>. </br>

* The functions you need to implement are in question.c, these functions are:</br>
void set_age(struct Person* p, int new_age): This function overwrites the age member of p, with new_age.</br>
void print_info(struct Person* p): This function will print the initial and age of p.</br>
You should print initial first, then the age. Also, there should be a new line after each member.

##Â NOTES:
You will complete the set_age() and print_info() functions in question.c.</br>
If you get an out of memory error, try again in a few seconds.</br>
You should not need utility functions.</br>
You are not allowed to change run.c or <b>question.h</b>.</br>
You should not use print statements in <b>set_age.c</b>.</br>
