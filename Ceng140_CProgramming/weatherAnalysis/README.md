# SIMPLE WEATHER TEMPERATURE CONVERSION

* You will get Fahrenheit weather degree for weekdays (from Mondays to Friday)
* Your task is to convert each day's degree to celsius and print them with the average of the days.
* Fahrenheit to celsius formula is:
    * T(°C) = (T(°F) - 32) / 1.8

## Details
* Firstly, prompt the user by asking degree in Fahrenheit for 5 days.
* Convert them to celsius form for each day.
* Print them in the same order, with their average at the end.
* Obey the output format exactly.

### Example Input:
41.5 52.6 34.3 12.9 23.1

### Example Output:
Celsius on Mon: 5.28

Average: 0.49

### In output, notice that:

* All temperature measurements use 2 precision points.
* Items are separated by a single space.
* Each line ends with a new line character including the last one.
* Average temperature is in celcius unit.
